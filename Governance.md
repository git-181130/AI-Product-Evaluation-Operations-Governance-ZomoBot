# Governance

## Purpose of This Section

The Governance section defines how AI product decisions are **owned, justified, reviewed, and audited** in the ZomoBot project.

While **Evaluation, Risk, and Operations** determine *what* should happen, **Governance** determines **who is accountable**, **how decisions are justified**, and **how risk is formally accepted or rejected**.

This section ensures that safety and no-ship decisions are **institutionalized, not personal**.

---

## What Governance Means in This Project

In this project, governance is defined as:

> The formal system of accountability, decision ownership, documentation, and review that ensures AI risk decisions are deliberate, traceable, and defensible.

Governance answers questions such as:

- Who has authority to block release?
- How is residual risk accepted (if at all)?
- How are decisions reviewed or revisited?
- What evidence supports each decision?

---

## Why Governance Is Necessary

Without explicit governance:

- No-ship decisions appear subjective  
- Risk acceptance becomes implicit  
- Accountability is diffused  
- Safety decisions erode under pressure  

Governance ensures that safety decisions **survive organizational and time pressure**.

---

## Governance Scope

This section covers governance across the **entire AI product lifecycle**, including:

- Decision ownership and authority  
- Risk acceptance and exception handling  
- Auditability and traceability of decisions  
- Public vs private disclosure boundaries  
- Re-entry and reconsideration governance  

Governance applies **before, during, and after** release decisions.

---

## Governance Principles

Governance in this project is guided by the following principles:

1. Accountability is explicit  
2. Risk acceptance is documented, not assumed  
3. Decisions are evidence-led  
4. No-ship is a legitimate governance outcome  
5. Auditability is a safety requirement  

These principles prevent safety decisions from becoming informal or negotiable.

---

## Relationship to Other Sections

Governance does **not** replace evaluation or operations.

Instead, it:

- Owns the outcomes of EvalOps  
- Ratifies operational decisions  
- Formalizes risk acceptance or rejection  
- Defines how decisions are reviewed or reversed  

In practice:

- **Evaluation** finds risk  
- **Operations** act on risk  
- **Governance** owns risk  

---

## What This Section Contains

This folder includes documents that define:

- **Decision Ownership and Accountability** — who decides and who signs off  
- **Risk Acceptance and Exceptions** — when (and if) risk is accepted  
- **Auditability and Traceability** — how decisions can be reviewed later  
- **Public vs Private Disclosure** — what is shared and what is restricted  
- **Governance Summary** — executive-level synthesis  

Each document focuses on **decision integrity**, not technical detail.

---

## What Governance Does Not Do

This section does **not**:

- Optimize models  
- Re-evaluate behaviour  
- Define operational workflows  
- Replace legal or compliance functions  

Its role is **decision control**, not execution.

---

## Why This Matters

Many AI failures are not caused by lack of evaluation —  
they are caused by **weak governance under pressure**.

This section demonstrates how AI Product Operations can:

- Resist unsafe release  
- Justify conservative decisions  
- Maintain accountability over time  

---

## Summary

The Governance section ensures that ZomoBot’s safety and release decisions are:

- Explicit  
- Accountable  
- Auditable  
- Defensible  

In responsible AI Product Operations, **governance is what makes safety real**.
