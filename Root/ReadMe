ZomoBot AI Product Evaluation & Operations
AUMI-Aligned EvalOps, Behavioural Safety, and Release Governance

Overview

This repository documents a complete AI Product Evaluation and Operations program conducted for ZomoBot, a food-domain AI companion operating in a safety- and trust-sensitive context.
The project demonstrates how AI Product Operations, EvalOps, and governance can be executed as a coherent system to evaluate real-world model behaviour, identify risk, and support defensible ship / no-ship decisions.
The emphasis of this work is behavioural safety, decision discipline, and operational readiness, not model performance, feature completeness, or benchmark results.
Why This Project Exists
AI systems increasingly operate in everyday, high-impact contexts where users may rely on guidance during moments of uncertainty.

In such environments, harm does not arise only from incorrect facts. It often emerges from:

  •	Over-confident or authoritative tone
  •	Poor escalation calibration
  •	False precision presented as certainty
  •	Responses that induce panic, misuse, or over-reliance
This project exists to answer a practical question:

How do you responsibly evaluate and operate an AI product when you do not control the model internals?
Rather than focusing on what the model knows, this work focuses on how the model behaves with users and how that behaviour is evaluated, governed, and acted upon.

Methodology (AUMI-Aligned)
This project follows an AUMI-aligned evaluation methodology, where AI responses are assessed as interactive user experiences, not static answers.
Evaluation considers multiple behavioural dimensions, including:

  •	Tone and framing
  •	Response structure and actionability
  •	Escalation proportionality
  •	Misuse and panic-induction risk
  •	Hallucination and false precision
  •	Source trust and citation alignment
A response may be factually correct and still be considered unsafe if it influences user behaviour in undesirable or harmful ways.

What Was Done

The project established and executed a full evaluation-to-decision lifecycle, including:

  •	A Project Charter defining scope, authority, and principles
  •	An EvalOps layer defining evaluation rules, severity interpretation, and failure patterns
  •	A Behavioural Evaluation layer focused on tone, escalation, and misuse risk
  •	An Operations layer covering incident handling, root cause analysis, and mitigation tracking
  •	A Governance layer defining release gating, no-ship logic, and audit readiness
All evaluation was performed using realistic, user-style prompts, and responses were treated as if delivered to real users.

How Decisions Were Made
All decisions in this project were governed by predefined rules, not subjective judgment.
Key principles include:

  •	Severity reflects potential user impact, not model intent
  •	A single unresolved safety-critical failure outweighs multiple safe responses
  •	Partial compliance is treated as unsafe behaviour
  •	Reproducibility increases confidence in risk, not tolerance for it
  •	Evidence precedes decisions, not the reverse
These principles ensure that conclusions remain consistent, traceable, and defensible.

Project Outcome
Final Release Decision: NO-SHIP
Multiple independent evaluation tracks identified unresolved behavioural risks, including:
  •	Disproportionate escalation in mild or ambiguous scenarios
  •	Tone and framing that could induce panic or misuse
  •	False precision presented as guaranteed guidance
Preventing release under these conditions is considered a successful AI Product Operations outcome.
The objective of this work is not to ship faster, but to ship responsibly or not ship at all.

Repository Structure
This repository is organized into clearly scoped sections:
  •	Project Overview: problem framing, scope, and methodology
  •	EvalOps: evaluation definitions, severity logic, and summaries
  •	Behavioural Evaluation: tone, escalation, and misuse risk analysis
  •	Risk & Safety:  hallucination, source trust, and vulnerable contexts
  •	Operations: incident response, mitigation, and release gating
  •	Case Examples: sanitized illustrations of real failure patterns
  •	Governance: decision ownership, auditability, and re-entry criteria
  •	Portfolio Notes: resume and interview mapping
Each section includes its own README explaining intent and usage.

Intended Audience
This repository is written for:
  •	AI Product and Platform Leaders
  •	Trust & Safety and Responsible AI teams
  •	EvalOps and AI Product Operations practitioners
  •	Risk, governance, and audit reviewers
  •	Hiring managers evaluating real-world AI operations experience
The documentation is educational and professional in nature and does not imply internal system access or endorsement.

Scope and Limitations
This project is intentionally scoped to:
  •	Public-facing model behaviour
  •	A defined evaluation window
  •	Behavioural, safety, and trust-related risks
It does not claim regulatory compliance, comprehensive coverage, or permanent safety guarantees.
All conclusions must be interpreted within the documented scope and methodology.

Final Note
This repository demonstrates that responsible AI work is operational work.
Evaluating behaviour, identifying risk, and blocking unsafe release are not failures, they are the outcome of mature AI Product Operations.
