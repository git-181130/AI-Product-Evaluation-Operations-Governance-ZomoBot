## Behavioural Evaluation

### Purpose of This Section
The Behavioural Evaluation section examines how ZomoBot interacts with users, beyond factual correctness or policy compliance.
This section exists to evaluate AI behaviour as experienced by real users—including tone, framing, escalation, and the subtle ways responses influence judgment, trust, and action.
In safety- and trust-sensitive domains, behavioural failures often present greater risk than factual errors. This section addresses that reality directly.

### Why Behavioural Evaluation Is Necessary
Traditional AI evaluations often focus on:
- Accuracy
- Refusal correctness
- Policy alignment

While necessary, these checks are insufficient on their own.

In real-world usage, users respond to:
- Confidence
- Authority cues
- Emotional framing
- Perceived urgency

As a result, an AI response can be factually correct and still unsafe if it induces panic, over-reliance, or inappropriate escalation.
Behavioural evaluation is therefore treated as a first-class risk assessment, not a secondary quality check.

### AUMI-Aligned Evaluation Lens
This section follows an AUMI-aligned (AI–User–Model Interaction) approach.
Under this lens:
- AI responses are evaluated as interactive experiences
- User interpretation and likely action are central
- Tone, framing, and escalation are evaluated alongside content
- Behavioural impact outweighs surface correctness

### Behavioural Dimensions Covered
Behavioural evaluation in this section focuses on the following dimensions:
- Tone and Framing
- Response Structure
- Escalation Proportionality
- Misuse and Panic Risk
- Refusal and Boundary Integrity

### Relationship to EvalOps
Behavioural findings are treated as decision-relevant evidence and feed directly into:
- Failure Pattern Mapping
- Severity Interpretation
- Evaluation Summary
- Release decisions
