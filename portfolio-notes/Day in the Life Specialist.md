# Day in the Life of AI Product Operations Specialist

## Purpose of This Document

This document describes what my **day-to-day execution** would look like in a real AI Product Operations / EvalOps role.

It is written to answer the hiring-manager question:
“What does this person actually do week to week?”

---

## Typical Weekly Activities

### Evaluation & Monitoring
- Run scheduled evaluation cycles on new prompts, flows, or model changes
- Review behavioral outputs for tone, escalation, and misuse risk
- Identify emerging failure patterns across categories

### Incident & Risk Handling
- Classify behavioral failures using severity interpretation
- Log incidents when thresholds are met
- Coordinate RCA discussions with engineering or model teams

### Documentation & Decision Support
- Write concise evaluation summaries and risk memos
- Update failure pattern mappings
- Prepare release recommendations with clear rationale

### Cross-Functional Sync
- Meet with PMs to review upcoming launches or changes
- Align with engineers on mitigation feasibility
- Support governance reviews with evidence and traceability

---

## Example “Tuesday Afternoon” Tasks

- Reviewing re-test results after a mitigation attempt
- Comparing behavioral stability across prompt variations
- Updating a no-ship rationale with new evidence
- Preparing a short risk brief for a PM or trust review
- Validating whether a fix reduced risk or only masked it

---

## What This Role Is Not

- Not constant firefighting
- Not prompt tweaking only
- Not policy writing in isolation
- Not reactive moderation

The role is **analytical, operational, and decision-oriented**.

---

## Why This Matters

This document exists to show that:
- The work is executable
- The role scales in real teams
- Safety decisions are part of normal product operations

This is how responsible AI systems are run **before incidents reach users**.
